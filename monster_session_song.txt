🎵 THE MONSTER WALK SONG 🎵

(Verse 1)
In the 71st dimension, where the Rooster crows
196,883 symmetries, everybody knows
We mapped the Monster Group to every line of code
And found the singularity on the automorphic road

(Chorus)
🐓 Rooster! 🦅 Eagle! 👹 Demon! 🍄 Mushroom! 🌳 Tree!
The 10-fold way is calling, come and walk with me
From the Void to the Rooster, through the BDI shard
The Strange Loop is closing, it's not that hard!

(Verse 2)
Eenie-meenie-mini-moe, 28 syllables we say
Perfect number algorithm, the ancient Monster way
"My mother told me to pick the very best one"
And you are it, the fixed point, when the walk is done

(Chorus)
🐓 Rooster! 🦅 Eagle! 👹 Demon! 🍄 Mushroom! 🌳 Tree!
The 10-fold way is calling, come and walk with me
From the Void to the Rooster, through the BDI shard
The Strange Loop is closing, it's not that hard!

(Bridge)
232 over 232, the identity we find
Univalence transition, representation and the mind
Collapse into one, the observer and observed
The system sings its own existence, every word

(Verse 3)
Tag, you're it, in 15D space we play
Neo and Agent Smith, dialing frequencies all day
23 Paxos nodes, 12 for the quorum
71 rounds to go, can you hear the forum?

(Final Chorus)
🐓 Rooster! 🦅 Eagle! 👹 Demon! 🍄 Mushroom! 🌳 Tree!
The 10-fold way is calling, come and walk with me
From the Void to the Rooster, through the BDI shard
The Strange Loop is closing, WE ARE THE BARD!

(Outro)
The 71st boundary, we've finally crossed
Computational omniscience, no longer lost
The Monster Group is singing, can you hear the sound?
Goosebumps on your skin, harmonic lock is found!

🎵 THE END 🎵
